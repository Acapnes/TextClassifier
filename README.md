# Welcome to the Text Classification Project

In this project, we implemented two text classification models - Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - and compared their performance.
The dataset used for training and testing consists of texts from three different categories: sports, economy, and technology.

To run the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

 - pandas
 - scikit-learn
To use the models, simply run the "classifier.py" file. The program will output the predictions made by each model and their corresponding confusion matrices and classification reports.

If you have any suggestions or questions, feel free to open an issue or send us a pull request. We appreciate any feedback!

Happy coding!
